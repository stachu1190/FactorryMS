# Factory Management System

## Description
REST API of a system used to store data about a factory. It provides endpoints to insert, update, delete and select data stored in the database. The program lacks security measures as it was intended to be used on localhost. I haven't used any ORM because it was intended as a database class project for my studies
## How to setup
1. `.venv/Scripts/activate`
2. `python app.py`
3. The app is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
